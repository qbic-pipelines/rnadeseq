## Gene Counts {.tabset}
The statistics of read assignment to genes are shown below. Interpretation of the different assignment types:

**Assigned:** The reads could properly be assigned to a gene or feature. \
**Unassigned_Ambiguity:** The reads could not be assigned to any gene because of its ambiguous character. This can be the case when e.g. a read maps to two different genes at the same time making the assignment ambiguous. \
**Unassigned_MultiMapping:** The reads could not be assigned to any gene because they map to several distinct locations on the reference genome. \
**Unassigned_NoFeatures:** The reads could not be assigned to any gene because their mapping position in the reference genome is not annotated.

### Percentages {-}

# Exploratory Analysis

## Raw and normalized count tables

The raw count table and normalized count tables are available [here](./DESeq2/gene_counts_tables). 
The differential expression analysis is performed using the raw gene count table. 
For PCA analysis and heatmap plotting, the regularized logarithm (rlog) normalized gene counts were employed.

## Overview - First Exploration of the Data

### Principal Component Analysis (PCA) 
A PCA plot of the normalized expression values was created to visualize the overall effect of experimental variations and any batch effects among samples.

```{r, echo=F, out.width="2000px", dpi=1200, fig.cap="", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(wd,"/DESeq2/plots/PCA_plot.svg"))
```

### Sample distance heatmap
A sample distance heatmap was generated from the distances of the normalized expression values for all samples. The closer the distance is to 0, the overall samples gene expression are more similar to each other.

```{r, echo=F, out.width="2000px", dpi=1200, fig.cap="", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(wd,"/DESeq2/plots/Heatmaps_of_distances.svg"))
```

# Differential Expression analysis

## List of differentially expressed genes

Analysis of the differential gene expression was performed using `DESeq2`. 
Genes were considered differentially expressed (DE) when the adjusted p-value was lower than 0.05 (padj < 0.05). 
The adjusted p-value is calculated in the `DESeq2` package with the Benjamini-Hochberg method and 
helps reduce the number of false postives (not real differentially expressed genes). 
The model design in DESeq2 was:`r cat(paste(readLines(params$path_design), collapse=" "))`.
The list of the first 20 differentially expressed genes is shown below. 
The differentially expressed genes are marked with "DE" in the filter column. 
The full table can be found [here](./DESeq2/final_gene_table/final_gene_list_DESeq2.tsv).

```{r}
library(DT)
library(tidyverse)
df_DE <- read.table(paste0(wd,"/DESeq2/final_gene_table/final_gene_list_DESeq2.tsv"), header=TRUE, sep="\t")
# list all the columns containing "padj"
padj = names(df_DE)[grepl("padj",names(df_DE))]
# take the last column in this list, order the dataframe according to ascending padj values in it; subset to the first 20 rows
df = head(df_DE %>% arrange(df_DE[[tail(padj, n=1)]]),20)
datatable(df, caption = "Outcome of Differential Expression analysis", extensions = c('Buttons', 'FixedColumns'), "Autofill", options = list(dom = 'Bfrtip', scrollX = T, scrollCollapse = T, buttons = c('copy', 'csv', 'excel', 'pdf', 'print')))

for (i in 1:length(contrnames)){

}
```

## Plot normalized counts of the genes

Plots of the normalized counts were generated for some example genes. Count normalization was performed by sequencing depth and adding a pseudocount of 1/2 to allow for log scale plotting. The plots are available at [boxplots_example_genes](./DESeq2/plots/boxplots_example_genes).

# Computational methods
<!--Different output in presence or absence of DEU analysis-->
Nextflow-based RNA-Seq pipeline release 1.3 https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq [^1] was used for the bioinfomatics analysis. Aggregation of the bioinformatics workflow analysis was conducted by `MultiQC `r as.character(version[version$V1=="MultiQC",2])`` [^2] [@ewels2016multiqc]. `FASTQC `r as.character(version[version$V1=="FASTQC",2])`` [^3] [@andrews2010fastqc] was used to determine quality of the FASTQ files. Subsequently, adapter trimming was conducted with `Trim Galore `r as.character(version[version$V1=="Trim Galore!",2])`` [^4] [@krueger2012trim]. `STAR v`r substring(as.character(version[version$V1=="STAR",2]), 7, )`` [@Dobin2013] aligner was used to map the reads that passed the quality control to the human genome GRCh 38 (Ensembl release 92). The evaluation of the RNA-seq experiment was performed with `RSeQC `r as.character(version[version$V1=="RSeQC",2])`` [@wang2012rseqc] and read counting of the features (e.g. genes) with `featureCounts `r as.character(version[version$V1=="featureCounts",2])``[@liao2014featurecounts].
For differential expression analysis, the raw read count table resulting from `featureCounts` is processed with the R package `DESeq2 v`r packageVersion("DESeq2")`` [@love2014differential].
<!-- If a DEU analysis has also been performed -->
```{r conditional_DEU, echo=FALSE, results='asis', eval=report_options$DEU}
# version = packageVersion("DEXSeq")
# cat(paste("For differential exon usage, the table count produced by `featureCounts` is processed with the R package `DEXSeq v`",version," [@anders2012detecting].", sep=''))
```
Graphs were also produced in the `RStudio v1.1.456` with `r R.version.string` mainly using the `R` package `ggplot2 v`r packageVersion("ggplot2")``. Reports were produced using the `R` package `rmarkdown v`r packageVersion("rmarkdown")`` while `knitr v`r packageVersion("knitr")`` and `DT v`r packageVersion("DT")`` were running behind the scenes. Sample similarity heatmap was created using `edgeR `r as.character(version[version$V1=="edgeR",2])`` R package.
