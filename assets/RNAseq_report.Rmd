# Read Mapping and Assignment

In order to analyze the gene counts per sample, the sequencing reads need to be mapped to the reference genome, and assigned to genes or other genomic regions. 
Here, the read mapping and gene assignment statistics are summarized, among other read processing quality control parameters. 
The read sequencing quality was analyzed using `FASTQC`. More detailed information is available in the `MultiQC` report of all samples available [here](./QC/multiqc_report.html).


## Summary statistics

The read mapping and gene assignment statistics, together with other quality control parameters are summarized here. 

The table below, extracted from the `MultiQC` report, shows a summary of the bioinformatics analysis quality control.

n_rows = nrow(df_DE_selected)

    Sample = Sample,
    LabID = Lab.ID,
    ReadNumber = color_bar("lightblue")(round((C1/1000000),2)),
    DuplicateReadsIntercept = ifelse(C2 > 1,
                                    cell_spec(C2, color="orange", bold=T),
                                    cell_spec(C2, color="black")),
    GCcontent = C3,
    TrimmedReads = C4,
    MappedReads =  ifelse(C5 > 80,
                          color_bar("lightblue")(C5),
                          color_bar("orange")(C5)),
    AssignedReads = ifelse(C6 > 60,
                          color_bar("lightblue")(C6),

  kable(escape=F,row.names =F, col.names=colnames) %>%
  kable_styling("hover") %>%
  scroll_box(width = "100%", height = "400px")
```

Note: Duplicate intercept (%) is the percentage of duplicate reads for the intercept of a linear model of duplicate reads vs read counts. High numbers of duplicates at low read counts can indicate low library complexity with technical duplication.

## Mapping Statistics {.tabset}

The read mapping statistics to the reference genome for each sample are shown below. Typical values for a good mapping lie at >80% uniquely mapped reads.

\

## Read Assignment Statistics {.tabset}
The statistics of read assignment to genes are shown below. Most reads should be assigned. Interpretation of the different assignment types:

* **Assigned:** The reads could properly be assigned to a gene or feature. \
* **Unassigned Ambiguity:** The reads could not be assigned to any gene because of its ambiguous character. 
This can be the case when e.g. a read maps 
to two different genes at the same time making the assignment ambiguous. \
* **Unassigned MultiMapping:** The reads could not be assigned to any gene because they map to several distinct locations on the reference genome. \
* **Unassigned NoFeatures:** The reads could not be assigned to any gene because their mapping position in the reference genome is not annotated.

# Gene Expression Data

## Raw and normalized count tables

The raw count table and normalized count tables are available [here](./differential_gene_expression/gene_counts_tables). 
The differential expression analysis is performed using the raw gene count table. 
For PCA analysis and heatmap plotting, the regularized logarithm (rlog) normalized gene counts were employed.
The vst (variant stabilizing transformation) normalized counts are also provided.

## Principal Component Analysis (PCA) 
A PCA plot of the rlog normalized gene expression visualizes the clustering of samples according to their gene expression. 
In this way, the overall effect of experimental conditions and sample grouping, and any batch effects are visualized.
The original plot can be downloaded [here](./differential_gene_expression/plots/PCA_plot.pdf).

\

```{r, echo=F, out.width="80%", dpi=1200, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(wd,"/differential_gene_expression/plots/PCA_plot.svg"))
```

\ 

```{r batch, echo=FALSE, eval=params$batch_effect, results='asis'}
cat("Batch effects were observed in the PCA, so batch effects were corrected. 
A PCA of the batch-effect corrected data is shown below and can be found [here](./differential_gene_expression/plots/PCA_batch_corrected_plot.pdf)")
```

```{r, echo=F, out.width="80%", dpi=1200, fig.align='center', eval=params$batch_effect}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(wd,"/differential_gene_expression/plots/PCA_batch_corrected_plot.svg"))
```

## Sample distance heatmap
A sample distance heatmap was generated from the distances of the normalized expression values for all samples. 

This visualizes how similar the samples are to each other according to gene expression. 
Two samples have more similar gene expression if their distance is closer to 0 (darker blue).
The original plot can be downloaded [here](./differential_gene_expression/plots/Heatmaps_of_distances.pdf).

```{r, echo=F, out.width="80%", dpi=1200, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(wd,"/differential_gene_expression/plots/Heatmaps_of_distances.svg"))
```

# Differential Expression analysis

To perform differential gene expression analysis, the gene expression data between two sample groups is compared.
These comparisons are called *contrasts*. For this analysis, the following contrasts or comparisons were made:

```{r contrasts, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, bootstrap.show.message=FALSE, include=FALSE}
df_contr <- read.table(params$path_contrasts, header=FALSE, sep="\t")
contrnames = df_contr$V1
```

```{r contrasts_block, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
for (i in 1:length(contrnames)){
  cat(paste("* ", contrnames[i], "\n"))
}
```

## List of differentially expressed genes

The analysis of the differential gene expression was performed using `DESeq2`. 
Genes were considered differentially expressed (DE) when the adjusted p-value was lower than 0.05 (padj < 0.05). 
The adjusted p-value is calculated in the `DESeq2` package with the Benjamini-Hochberg method. P-value adjustment 
helps reduce the number of false postives (not real differentially expressed genes). 

The linear model employed to model gene expression in DESeq2 was:

```{r} 
cat(paste(readLines(params$path_design), collapse=" "))
```

The list summarizing all found differentially expressed genes for any contrast (comparison) is shown here. 
The differentially expressed genes are marked with "DE" in the outcome column if they were found 
differentially expressed for any of the contrasts considered.

The table for download can be found [here](./differential_gene_expression/final_gene_table/final_DE_gene_list.tsv).

Additional tables for all individual contrasts are provided [here](./differential_gene_expression/DE_genes_tables).

<!-- Show table here removed as I dont like showing only top 20 genes.
```{r}
df_DE <- read.table(paste0(wd,"/differential_gene_expression/final_gene_table/final_DE_gene_list.tsv"), 
                          header=TRUE, sep="\t")
padj = names(df_DE)[grepl("padj",names(df_DE))]
df = head(df_DE %>% arrange(df_DE[[tail(padj, n=1)]]),20)
kable(df, escape=F,row.names =F) %>%
  kable_styling("hover") %>%
  scroll_box(width = "100%", height = "400px")
```
-->

## Volcano plots of DE genes

Volcano plots display the DE genes in Log2 Fold Change values (x axis) 
against their adjusted p-value (y axis) in a form of a -log10. Only significantly DE genes are shown (padj > 0.05). 
It is recommended to select differentially expressed genes with a Log2FC > 1 or < -1 (blue lines show that threshold).
Here, volcano plots for all considered contrasts are shown. Hover over the dots to show the gene names.

## Boxplots of gene normalized counts

Plots of the normalized counts were generated for some example genes. Count normalization was performed by 
sequencing depth and adding a pseudocount of 1/2 to allow for log scale plotting. 
The plots are available at [boxplots_example_genes](./differential_gene_expression/plots/boxplots_example_genes).

Analysis of the differential exon usage was performed using DEXSeq. Exons were considered differentially used (DEU) when the adjusted 
p-value was lower than 0.1 (padj < 0.1); the adjusted p-value helps reduce the number of false postives (not real differentially used exons). 
For each gene, the model design in DEXSeq had the formula: ", design, ". The list of all the differentially used exons can be 
found [here](./input/DEXSeq/DEXSeq_results_significant.txt).", sep=""))

The results for all work packages, as described in the [quote](./) can be found in this report. 
Further support for this project will be restricted to the results presented in this report (e.g. requests to update/manipulate figures and tables). 
For further analysis (e.g. the re-analysis of the dataset) we will generate a new quote containing cost estimates.

# Computational methods

The Nextflow-based nf-core RNA-Seq pipeline (https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq)[^1] was used for the bioinfomatics analysis. 
An aggregation of the bioinformatics workflow analysis was conducted by `MultiQC `r as.character(version[version$V1=="MultiQC",2])`` [^2] [@ewels2016multiqc]. 
`FASTQC `r as.character(version[version$V1=="FASTQC",2])`` [^3] [@andrews2010fastqc] was used to determine quality of the FASTQ files. 
Subsequently, adapter trimming was conducted with `Trim Galore `r as.character(version[version$V1=="Trim Galore!",2])`` [^4] [@krueger2012trim]. 
`STAR v`r substring(as.character(version[version$V1=="STAR",2]), 7, )`` [@Dobin2013] aligner was used to map the reads that passed the quality 
control to the reference genome. 
The evaluation of the RNA-seq experiment was performed with `RSeQC `r as.character(version[version$V1=="RSeQC",2])`` [@wang2012rseqc] and 
read counting of the features (e.g. genes) with `featureCounts `r as.character(version[version$V1=="featureCounts",2])``[@liao2014featurecounts].
For differential expression analysis, the raw read count table resulting from `featureCounts` is processed with the R package `DESeq2 v`r packageVersion("DESeq2")`` [@love2014differential].

<!-- If a DEU analysis has also been performed -->

```{r conditional_DEU, echo=FALSE, results='asis', eval=report_options$DEU}
# version = packageVersion("DEXSeq")
# cat(paste("For differential exon usage, the table count produced by `featureCounts` is processed with the R package `DEXSeq v`",version," [@anders2012detecting].", sep=''))
```
Graphs were also produced in the `RStudio v1.1.456` with `r R.version.string` mainly using the `R` package `ggplot2 v`r packageVersion("ggplot2")``. Final reports were produced using the `R` package `rmarkdown v`r packageVersion("rmarkdown")``, with the `knitr v`r packageVersion("knitr")`` and `DT v`r packageVersion("DT")`` R packages. The sample similarity heatmap was created using the `edgeR `r as.character(version[version$V1=="edgeR",2])`` R package.
